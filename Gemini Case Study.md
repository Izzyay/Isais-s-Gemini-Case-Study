# Gemini Case Study



## Overview and Origin
  *  Gemini Trust Company, LLC is a crytpocurrency exchange were its customers can buy, sell, or store digital assets. The company was founded in 2014 and launched in 2015 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also known as the Winklevoss twins. 



## Business Activities
*    The crypto exchange is available in all 50 U.S. states and offers close to 100 cryptocuurencies to buy, sell, or trade. They offer insurance to protect their customers assets ans strong user security along with it. They offer two factor authentication to protect accounts and a password or email change will trigger an account pause. 
* As of june of last year, Gemini announced the acquisition of Shard X. Shard X is a developer of MPC (multi-party cryptographic technology). Gemini is integrating Shard X's MPC technology into their multi-site key management and signing imfrastructure. This is to improve the speed with transfering customer assets, and the usage of Gemini and to make the their ecosystem more secure.
* Gemini offers customers to earn interest with the crypto they choose to invest in and to also pay for products and services with their crypto. Gemini is currently working on a credit card which currently has a waitlist. The  card has no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees and no echange fees to acquire crypto rewards.



## Landscape
* Gemini is one of the many exchanges apart of the cryptocurrency landscape. Some other major crypto exchanges that are a major competitor are Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com.
* Cryptocurrency over the past decade has grown in all sorts of ways and is changing up a lot of things for people  and businesses, especially banks. A person can now buy and sell an item or service for cryptocurrency instead of their native currency. Someone can transfer crypto to anyone they would like to and the transaction is near instant. Crypto can be even sent internationally and is faster than sending money overseas and waiting for that transactions to go through.



## Results
* As of right now Gemini is in over 60 countries. As of November 2021, Gemini has a valuation of $7.1 billion and nearly has 100 cryptocurrencies to buy, sell, or trade with more on the way. The service Gemini pay is supported by 30,000 retailers.



## Recommendations
* I reccomend for Gemini to add more crypto to buy, sell or trade for its customers as some of their competitors offer more than 100 cryptocurrencies for its customers. 
* I would also say for Gemini to work on its customer service as the exchange doesn't have the best overall reviwes for customer satisfaction. Gemini offers great services and products and security but not having the best customer service can very much get in the way of them having their products and services thrive.
